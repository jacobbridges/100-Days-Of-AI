# 100 Days of Learning AI

This repo is a personal challenge to myself to learn more about AI and document my findings in 100 bite-sized "lessons". By the end I hope to:

- Learn more about LLMs, prompt engineering, task agents, etc.
- Document my learnings each day with just enough context to jog my memory in the future, and just enough links for someone else to follow along.
- Get better. At writing. With words.

## Days

> TODO - Use a table instead of a list for this section.

- [Day 1](day/1/README.md) - Ensure some models load on my local machine.
- [Day 2](day/2/README.md) - Learn about prompt templates from `langchain`.
- [Day 3](day/3/README.md) - Practice some prompt engineering.
- [Day 4](day/4/README.md) - Different methods of summarization: Stuffing, Map-Reduce, & Refine
