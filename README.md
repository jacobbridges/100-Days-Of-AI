# 100 Days of Learning LangChain

This repo is a personal challenge to myself to learn a little about LangChain every day, and to document my work. I pledge to:

- Keep this file (`/README.md`) updated with a link to each new day's learnings.
- Document my learnings each day with just enough context to jog my memory in the future, and just enough links for someone else to follow along.
- Get better. At writing. With words.

## Days

> TODO - Use a table instead of a list for this section.

- [Day 1](day/1/README.md) - Ensure two models load on my local machine.
