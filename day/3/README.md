# Day 3

Going into day 3, I am eager to apply some of the learnings from the past few days! We know how to load models, and how to use simple prompts. Let's try to solve a few problems with only LLMs and prompting.

## Notebooks

### 1-paraphrase-detection.ipynb

Explore statement similarity. How complex of statements can LLMs handle?

### 2-respond-in-format.ipynb

Explore how to coerce LLMs into responding with a predetermined format. Also, quite unexpectedly, teach LLMs how to only respond ONCE.
