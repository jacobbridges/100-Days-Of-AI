    "Map-Reduce has been a paradigm in programming for a long time. I was first introduced to this paradigm when I learned functional programming in 2013, but Google has written papers on this going back to 2004. Here is a [link to a Cornell lecture](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2014sp/lectures/5/map-fold-map-reduce) that dives deep into the Map-Reduce paradigm if you are interested in learning more.\n",

These cis-acting elements are controlled through interactions with small RNAs (sRNAs) or ligand binding, creating inducible genetic control elements.\\n5. The potential use of nucleic acid design algorithms in creating RNA regulators de novo could have significant advantages over protein-based genetic control systems due to its versatile genetic regulation controlled by simple RNA structures.\\n6. This suggests a promising future for RNA synthetic biology and molecular programming at the bottom up level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>'"

I read a study this past week that half of children born in America now are born outside of wedlock. So that&#x27;s a pretty historical number that half now is outside of wedlock                                            </td><td>- The speaker begins by expressing his pleasure at being with the audience and appreciating the cold weather.\\n- They ask the congregation to open their Bibles to Matthew 1, where they left off last week in discussing Jesus&#x27; genealogy.\\n- A study mentioned that half of children born in America are now born outside of wedlock, which is a significant statistic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\\n<tr><td>And that&#x27;s not because there are single mothers everywhere.

So marriage is a very serious full commitment. And while we may be saying generationally today is America is like I don&#x27;t want to make that kind of commitment. I want like my secret license to kind of pull out if I need to                                        </td><td>The text discusses the difference between relationships and marriage, highlighting how in a relationship there is more freedom to back out when desired, whereas in marriage, individuals make vows that are meant to be lifelong commitments until death separates them. The speaker suggests that this idea of commitment may not appeal to younger generations in America today who prefer the option of pulling out if necessary.            </td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Matthew&#x27;s not going to let us do that in reference to Jesus.

The second one, it&#x27;s bigger, but it&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s the hypostatic union. OK, you&#x27;re OK. We can handle it. So the incarnation in the hypostatic union. What is the hypostatic union? Because the angel in precious few words just said this to Mary. Well, here&#x27;s the hypostatic union. Jesus as a person has two natures. He has a full and complete God nature. Jesus also has a full and complete human nature. Jesus is not kind of like God or kind of like a human. Jesus is 100% human                </td><td>- The hypostatic union refers to Jesus having two natures: fully divine and fully human.\\n- It&#x27;s not about Jesus being &quot;kind of&quot; God or &quot;kind of&quot; human, but rather 100% human and 100% divine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\\n<tr><td>And he&#x27;s 100% God. He is co-equal with God the Father. He is, as the Nicene Creed says, very God of very God. Jesus himself said, I am. So in the Old Testament, the I am, that was God. Jesus said, I am. So Jesus is fully and completely God is God the Father is. But for instance, he&#x27;s also in this his paramount for us to believe he is our savior who is fully human. As theologian Paul ends notes, if Jesus wasn&#x27;t fully human, the death, his death on the cross, was in illusion. So Jesus is just like Adam, only perfect.

Jesus is uniquely human in that he alone can be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. But because Jesus is God, he can resist sin and Satan in a way that you and I can&#x27;t. That makes him our savior. Jesus is the God man. It&#x27;s the hypostatic union. You should love that. Truths. And so what&#x27;s the incarnation? Well, the incarnation is simply what we read. The Holy Spirit passed over Mary to bring about the hypostatic union.
