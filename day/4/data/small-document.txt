RNA is increasingly recognized as a powerful biomolecule for controlling gene expression and engineering synthetic cellular functions. One of the reasons for this is that natural and engineered RNA-based regulators are now available that can control almost every aspect of gene expression. In addition these regulatory functions can be enacted and tuned by the programmable formation of specific RNA structures, which mediate interactions with cellular machinery to perform gene regulation. For example in bacteria, the formation of simple RNA structures such as hairpins within mRNAs can prevent their transcription and translation. Moreover, these cis-acting RNA structures can be further controlled through interacting with trans-acting small RNAs (sRNAs) or binding of a ligand, to prevent or allow their formationâ€”in effect creating inducible genetic control elements. This combination of versatile genetic regulation controlled by simple RNA structures creates the intriguing possibility of using nucleic acid design algorithms to create RNA regulators de novo. Thus RNA as a substrate for molecular programming has a potential major advantage over less designable protein regulators, and there is great promise for RNA synthetic biology to allow for the bottom up molecular-level design of genetic control systems.
